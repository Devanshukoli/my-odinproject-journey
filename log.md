## Date : 21-Nov-2024
- So, I have started this project long ago. But just now stumbled upon it, so here is log for continuing my everyday only **TheOdinProject** journey.
- Today : mostly I check out the page of [html-boiler-plate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate).
- Basically understand about what is *doctype*, *html*, *lang=en*.
- Also putting the things that I got to know about in *Anki*.
